          Hello! My name is Siyuan Yu. I am a Computer Science Master student
          from University Of California at San Diego. I am from Guangzhou,
          China, the city of five goats, also the city of flowers. It is a
          beautiful city with a long history. I studied Computer Engineering in
          my undergraduate with a focus on Embedded Systems and I had worked at
          a semiconductor company for seven months. In the graduate school, I am
          studying Computer Science with a focus of Artificial Intelligence.
          Right now, I am particularly interested in building full stack
          applications with the help of machine learning to help improve
          peopleâ€™s life quality. Outside of school and work, I am an extremely
          outdoorsy person, which is why the quarantine is driving me CRAZY ðŸ˜„
          (but please stay home and stay safe). When the pandemic is over, I
          would like to look for friendly people to play tennis, basketball,
          soccer, or simply go hiking! I also enjoy playing classical piano
          music. Bach is too hard for me, but I like playing some Mozart ðŸ™‚
          Thank yâ€™all for reading through such a long description!Now that you
          have gotten an image of me, please shoot me a message if you would
          like to connect with me! My biggest passion is to make friends! Have a
          good rest of the day with food and stay safe ðŸ˜‰
